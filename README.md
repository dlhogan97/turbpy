# turbpy
## Offline land-surface turbulence schemes 
Package designed to allow simulation of surface turbulent fluxes outside a land-model context.

![Example of the stability functions available in the turbpy package.](https://github.com/klapo/turbpy/blob/master/TF.OfflineTurb.Idealized.pdf)

a) The stability corrections for the bulk aerodynamic methods

b) the conductance for all methods

c) the resulting sensible heat fluxes for each method assuming a surface temperature of 265K, wind speed of 1 m/s, 
surface roughness of 0.005, and varying the air temperature from 253K (Ri = -1) to 293K (Ri = 2).

See the ipython notebook [TF.turbpyTest](./TF.turbpyTest.ipynb) for an example of how the turbpy package can be used. The image above is generated in [TF.turbpyDemonstration](./TF.turbpyDemonstration.ipynb).
